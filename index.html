    <p>American Crows are familiar over much of the continent: large, intelligent, all-black birds with hoarse, cawing voices. They are common sights in treetops, fields, and roadsides, and in habitats ranging from open woods and empty beaches to town centers. They usually feed on the ground and eat almost anything - typically earthworms, insects and other small animals, seeds, and fruit but also garbage, and carrion. Their flight style is unique, a patient, methodical flapping that is rarely broken up with glides.

    <p id="bio info">The crow is a large, long-legged, thick-necked bird with a heavy, straight bill. In flight, the wings are fairly broad and rounded with the wingtip feathers spread like fingers. The short tail is rounded or squared off at the end. <br><br>
American Crows are all black, even the legs and bill. When crows molt, the old feathers can appear brownish or scaly compared to the glossy new feathers.</p>

    <div id="habitat">
<h1 id="hab">HABITAT</h1>
        <P>American Crows are common birds of fields, open woodlands, and forests. They thrive around people, and you’ll often find them in agricultural fields, lawns, parking lots, athletic fields, roadsides, towns, and city garbage dumps.
            <br><br>
The range of the American crow now extends across the US and into parts of Canada and Mexico. The increase in trees during the past century due to fire suppression and tree planting facilitated a large expansion of the American crow as well as expansions of many other species of birds. Virtually all types of country from wilderness, farmland, parks, open woodlands to towns and major cities are inhabited; it is absent only from Pacific temperate rain forests and tundra habitats.

    <p>American Crows are very social, sometimes forming flocks in the thousands. Inquisitive and sometimes mischievous, crows are good learners and problem-solvers, often raiding garbage cans and picking over discarded food containers. They’re also aggressive and often chase away larger birds including hawks, owls and herons.</p>

          <td><p><span class="diettext"><br>The American crow is omnivorous. It will feed on invertebrates of all types, carrion, scraps of human food, seeds, and various grains. American crows are active hunters and will prey on mice, frogs, and other small animals. The American crow is one of only a few species of bird that has been observed modifying and using tools to obtain food.<br><br>
          Like most crows, they will scavenge at landfills, scattering garbage in the process. Where available, corn, wheat and other crops are a favorite food. These habits have historically caused the American crow to be considered a nuisance. However, it is suspected that the harm to crops is offset by the service the American crow provides by eating insect pests.<br></span><br></p></td>
